# Run

Load "ImageNet_images_all" (ImageNet images for testing), set up testing image index "index_test_image = 1", set up "convnet = alexnet()", directly run "main_AlexNet.m". 

You will get the saliency for AlexNet and adversarial L0 distance. Similarly, you can calculate for other ImageNet models by setting up different networks name on "convnet", such as "resnet50", "resnet101", etc.

Folder "ExperimentResults" contains the experimental results on Image-1 to image-13.
